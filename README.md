# NybC

## Run the intepreter
To run the interpreter, unzip the file, open the terminal and navigate to the NybC-main folder, where the 'src' and 'test' folders are located.
From there, create a new txt file that contains the code you want to run.
Then to execute that code run this command:
```terminal
java -jar NybC.jar NameOfYourFile.txt
```
